# RandomPasswordGenerator

This was a small program devised as a way to help me learn Python syntax and at the same time end up with something useful.  The idea was an offline password geneartor that could be used to generate very strong passwords with security in mind.  My goal was to also prevent any duplication or overuse of special characters.  I would be open to constructive feedback and suggestions.   I'm old school so I probably have a lot more comments than some developers like to see.

I don't profess to be any sort of security expert.  This could be considered insecure or a bad way to accomplish the objective.  This started out as just a way to learn Python.
